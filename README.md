# IACM App - Android

The Interactive and Accessible Campus Map (IACM) is a sub-team within the MOBI group of EPICS. Our goal is to create an application that can assist people with accessibility requirements in navigating the Purdue campus. This app is written in Java and heavily uses the Google Maps SDK.

## How to run the IACM App:

1. Ensure your choice of IDE is installed. Android Studio was used for 1.0 and 2.0. 

2. Then run <code>git clone https://github.itap.purdue.edu/EPICSGroup/IACM_Android/tree/master </code> to get the app source code onto your computer.

3. Build the project, it might take ~10 minutes.

4. Run the Code. Happy Coding!

<h1> Steps for Script (Explaination) </h1>
1. The KML Parser outputs parsedbuildings.txt <br>
2. The same file gets put into IACM_script.py <br>
3. <u> That </u> gets copied into MapsActivity.java and has code on top of it. <br>

<br> <i> We did not write this architecture, we inherited it, unfortunately. Sincerely, IACM Spring 2022. </i>

Feel free to reach out to IACM advisors for any technical queries regarding running the app.  <br>
Please refer to final design document of Spring 2020 IACM MOBI for a technical explanation of each module and class of the application.
